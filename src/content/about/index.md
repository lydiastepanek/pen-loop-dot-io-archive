I'm a freelance software developer based in New York. I work with clients to improve their dev setup processes and implement database changes without breaking the developer experience.

I spent the past decade as a software and DevOps engineer working on infrastructure scaling problems at places like MongoDB and Codecademy. In my free time, I build apps and run a cybersecurity blog that has made the front page of Hacker News multiple times.
