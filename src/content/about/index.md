founder:
  quotation: "“After building and launching multiple apps, I started Pen Loop to help companies build + design new features, like implementing better data architecture. My specialty is databases, DevOps, and building scalable systems that are meticulously documented, rigorously tested, and seamlessly integrated into a robust CI/CD pipeline. That way, when engineers join or leave your team, there is a sane codebase in place for them to hit the ground running.”"
