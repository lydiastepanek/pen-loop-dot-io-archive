Iâ€™m a DevOps and Full Stack Consultant based in New York, specializing in improving development setup processes and implementing database changes without compromising the developer experience. With a decade of experience as a software and DevOps engineer at leading tech companies like MongoDB and Codecademy, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in solving complex infrastructure scaling problems.

In my free time, Iâ€™m passionate about building apps and sharing my knowledge through a cybersecurity blog that has repeatedly made the front page of Hacker News. My hands-on experience in both large-scale environments and personal projects gives me a unique perspective on how to optimize development processes for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
